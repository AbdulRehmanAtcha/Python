my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# print(my_tuple)


# Tuples are immutable. Like we cant do like this: my_tuple[0] = 12

# For single element tuple the syntax will be like this: new_tuple = (1,)
new_tuple = (1,)
# print(new_tuple)


# Tuple Unpacking like as destructuring
a, b, c = my_tuple
# print(a)
print(my_tuple.count(1))
